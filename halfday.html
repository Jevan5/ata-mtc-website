        <hr class="my-4">
        
        <p>The Half-Day Tennis Camps are organized by a USPTA Certified Tennis Professional and include 2 hours of tennis instruction with small breaks.  There will be a FREE BBQ Lunch on the last day and campers can purchase snacks from the clubhouse throughout the week (ie. freezies, drinks etc.) at the Tuck Shop. Racquets can be provided if needed. Campers will be divided up according to age and tennis ability and all levels are welcome. At the younger ages we will play a variety of tennis games to assist in their progression and the older ages will often play a tournament to finish the week. Our Afternoons are dedicated to our TEENS TRAINING SESSIONS from 1-3pm!!!</p>
